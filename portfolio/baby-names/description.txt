This was completed for CSE 154. Baby Names is a web page that allows you to search a name and return a meaning for the name as well as a graph of the popularity of the name over the past 13 decades. At the top of the graph the decade is displayed. The number within each bar is the ranking of that name for that decade. The closer to 1 a name is the more popular it was that year. If a bar is 0 it was not within the top 1000 names for that decade. The style of the page was chosen by the professor. The backend of the page searches through a list of 5600 names and returns the meaning and ranks to the page in the form of JSON. Then javascript outputs it into the form you see on the page.
