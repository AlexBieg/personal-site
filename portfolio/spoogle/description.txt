This application uses both the Spotify API and Google Maps API to create playlists that are the length of a given trip. Users can choose a starting point, destination, and method of travel. Then they input search terms and a playlist, of the same length of the trip, is built. If the user is logged into Spotify, through the provided interface, they can save the playlist to their account.
