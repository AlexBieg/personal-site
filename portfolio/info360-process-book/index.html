                    This process book takes you through my expericence making a carpooling
                    application called Driver. It will take you through each step of the process and explain
                    our reasoning behind it. If you would like to skip around, the navigation bar
                    at the top will take you to the noted section. This was done for INFO 360.

                    For the first few parts Bryce was not with us. I will let you know when he joins
                    the Driver team.
                </p>

            <div id="issue">
                <h2>Issue</h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was to come up with a problem to solve. It had to relate
                    to surviving college, but nothing else was really specified. We started thinking
                    about things currently in our lives that we did not like. I mentioned I could
                    never decide where to get food. We talked about that for awhile, but ultimately
                    decided there were already many applications that solved that issue. As the class
                    was nearly over Huy mentioned how he was going to have to ride the bus home today
                    because his carpool buddy was not able to drive that day. I think this struck a chord with
                    Saki and me. All college students have been trying to get somewhere, but have to
                    take the bus or walk because they do not have a car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From here we started to define our issue. UW students have 4 major potential ways of
                    getting to campus. First is the bus. UW students have the Upass so there is not a
                    monetary barrier, but if you live in Bellevue for instance, the bus to get here only
                    runs every 30 minutes. Second is walking. This works perfectly fine if you live close
                    to campust, but our research shows that more than 11 thousand students live too far
                    to walk. Third is just owning your own car. This is probably the best solution in terms of
                    features, but owning a car is expensive and finding a place to park can be challenging.
                    Last is to join a carpool. This is often a great comprimise between walking and owning a
                    car, but people are often unreliable and you do not know who you will be riding with.
                    So we decided to improve on carpools.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="idea">
                <h2>Idea</h2>
                <p>
                    So from that issue we create the basic idea. We wanted to create a carpool app.
                    We were not sure what our scope should be. At first we wanted to make an app
                    that allowed students to go anywhere, not just campus, but as we talked to our
                    professor and TA it was clear that we should narrow our scope. So filtered it down
                    to just students going to and from campus. Specifically we wanted to serve the seattle
                    campus. This meant that any student who attends a different campus such as Tacoma
                    would be out of scope for our idea. From here we went into our ideation phase
                    to determine what features we wanted our application to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To confirm that this idea would resonate with our userbase we decided to conduct
                    a few interviews. Each of us chose one person to interview. We prepared a loose
                    set of questions and tried to let the person speak honestly about our proposed idea.
                    In the end we came back together and synthisized our responses. On the whole people
                    were positve about the idea we had. In light of this we moved forward with our
                    idea.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="ideation">
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    At this point in the process we all went off individually and came up with
                    40 ways we could create this idea. This is where Bryce joined us.
                    It was significantly harder than I expected to
                    come up with that many ideas, but in the end I made it. Below is are the ideas
                    I came up with. Please excuse the bad drawings. We were allowed to come up with
                    crazy idea just to get our brains flowing with the creative process. So some
                    of these ideas are unrealistic. Two of my ideas really stuck out to me. The
                    schedule matcher which automatcally matched up people who had similar schedules and
                    the same class study session which allowed people in the same class to register
                    carpools so that they could study for that class on the way to school.

            <div id="choosing">
                <h2>Choosing</h2>
                <p>
                    This is where the team as a whole met back up to choose our favorite ideas out
                    of the ones we created. This was somewhat of a tall order because collectively we
                    had created 160 ideas. To save all of us time and a headache we had each person
                    choose their favorite ideas out of the ones they had create to present to the
                    group. I chose the two I mentioned above. Huy wanted to have parking spots designated
                    for carpools, because parking in the University District can be very difficult or
                    expensive. We all thought this was a great idea and decided to add it to our plan.
                    I presented my two ideas. The group really liked the schedule matcher, so we added
                    it. They were less than enthused about the study idea. I tried to argue for it, but in the
                    end I had to let it go. Bryce came up with the idea to make everyone who logged in
                    prove they were a UW student by using UW NetId. We all thought that was a great idea.
                    Lastly Saki wanted to create a service that catered to professors as well, but we
                    wanted to keep our scope small for this project. So we did not move forward with her
                    idea.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="rethinking">
                <h2>Rethinking</h2>
                <p>
                    At this point Bryce asked us how happy we were with our idea. Since he came in late
                    he did not really have any input into what our issue was. He was not really excited
                    by making a carpooling app and wanted to switch to something else. In particular
                    he wanted to switch to an app to encourage students to vote more. He said this fit with
                    our current goals because students voting more would mean that public transportation
                    would fit our needs better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saki was opposed to this idea because she is not able to vote in the US. This type
                    of app would not serve someone like her in any way. Huy was very much in favor of the
                    idea. I said I did not want to switch focuses now, because we had already done so
                    much work on our current topic. At this everyone agreed so we stayed with our carpool
                    idea.

            <div id="screens">
                <h2>Screens</h2>
                <p>
                    At this stage we finally started prototyping our idea. Again we each decided to
                    come up with our own designs and to test them on people before merging anything
                    together. This is an example screen from my prototype.

                    After we had done individual prototypes we came back together and made a team prototype
                    with all of the comments we got on our individual ones. For example my prototype did
                    not have a rating system. So we made sure to add that in the team one. Again after
                    this was finished we did more testing with people. Below is an updated version of
                    the screen above after all the comments we had.

                    Finally after this was tested we did high fidelity mockups. These were done with
                    the aid of computer software so that they would look more realistic. Below is again
                    the same screen but now updated to high fidelity.

                <h2>Commercial</h2>
                <p>
                    Our last major deliverable was to make a commercial. To start this we created a
                    story board of our ideas. We wanted to make the begining start first person and
                    then switch to third person as the story progressed. As our main character is
                    using Driver and being happy the viewers see other people being unhappy. Below is
                    an excerpt from our story board we used to create the commercial. All of the other
                    members of the team shot and acted in the video. I edited the video.

                <p>
                    We also created a specification that details all parts of our app. <a href="FinalSpecification.pdf" download>Click Here</a> to download the pdf.

                    In the end I am very happy with our product.
                    I think we created something could actually be helpful to many people. Really in
                    creating something that is the goal. Make something that will be used by people.
                    In our case I think, given enough time to implement it, our app would be used. We
                    had solid evidence that there was a need for it. We ideated many ideas.
                    We went through multiple interations of screens. We user tested many times. We worked
                    really hard on this project. I think we made something awesome. I hope you do too.
