PYPO is a new type of social media, news, blog site. It is focused at mothers and career women by creating a place for them to interact with their peers. We built this site on top of WordPress by creating a custom theme. I was given a design pdf to work from and was tasked with making it work on the site. Much of my time was spent in HTML and CSS creating the look of the site. I also made sure that the site was mobile responsive. Beyond that I worked with PHP and JavaScript to make the site interactive. I needed to create custom functions in PHP to work with the WordPress features and customize the site to fit the designs. With the help of a teammate, I created a custom plugin to allow for shortcodes in the site. We used the Advanced Custom Plugin to allow for much finer control over the posts that the team could put together.
