                PYPO is a social, news, blog site made for women over 35. It brings together women
                to openly discuss, and sometimes make fun of, societal pressures they feel. There
                are no topics that are off limits and the goal is to make everyone feel included.
                I worked on this site during my time at Green-Ideas. It was a very rewarding experience
                for me, as it was my first major project outside of school.

                Spoogle is a web application designed to make playlists for roadtrips. It uses the
                Spotify API and the Google Maps API. Basically all you have to do is tell it where
                you're starting and where you're going and give it some search terms and it will
                make a playlist for you. You can add it to your spotify account easily by signing in.

                Police Shootings was an assignment done for INFO 343: Front End Web Development.
                The goal was to visually represent a crowd sourced collection of police shootings
                visually across a map. The map was created using leafly. There are filters built into
                the map to allow better viewing of the data.
