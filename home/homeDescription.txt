Hello, my name is Alex. I create web pages. I have always had a fascination with the web. The concept of spreading knowledge through this medium is extremely interesting and exciting (at least to me). I have spent my time at the University of Washington trying to better my understanding of this amazing technology. I hope to be creating fun web pages for the rest of my life.
