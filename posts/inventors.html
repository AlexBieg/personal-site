<h3>Inventors!</h3>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/this-guy-turns-kids-fanciful-inventions-into-real-products/">link to article</a>

<p>I have always wanted to be an inventor. As a kid I would tape things together and pretend that I had made something new. I would make little sketches in notebooks to show what I wanted to make. As I grew older I began to grow away from those idealistic notions and built myself a metaphorical wall from creativity. Dominic Wilcox is helping other kids not grow out of their creativity.</p>

<p>Wilcox is a self-described inventor, currently living in London. He currently runs a workshop for kids where they come up with inventions that they want, he picks the best 60, and sends the designs out to be made by local designers. He says his goal is to encourage kids to think about problems and the best way to solve them. To be honest some of the kids ideas are pretty solid too. </p>

<p>Above is  the child’s mock-up as well as the finished prototype made by some local designer. I specifically chose this one to showcase because I think that it shows off the creativity of kids. The child in question thought, correctly, that electronic dimmers break easily and are hard to work with. So he came up with the idea of putting blinds on a lamp. You can choose how much light you want to get out just like any other blinds. Personally this is something that I may not have thought of because I am so ingrained with technology. He showed how kids have such an interesting perspective on the world.</p> 

<p>Lately I have been trying to let myself be creative again. It is hard because I convinced myself that I am bad at it. Of course that is ridiculous. I have been coding for 4 years now and, though it is a different type, it takes heaps of creativity. This article has shown me something I had forgotten a while ago. I used to think about the world very differently and maybe, periodically, I should look at it the same way again.</p>  

<p>There is another take away from article is to look in strange places to find cool answers. I may need these interesting and different sources when trying to solve a problem. Kids see the world in a different light. Beyond that there are many people who have different views of the world than me. A black man in England, to an asian man in africa, even just a woman in the US all have varied and interesting and important views of the world that I don’t or can’t have. So I will take from this article the renewed quest to culture myself as much as possible and when that fails, surround myself with the best kind of people. We live in a diverse world of diverse people. If you try to be cut off from that you are missing out the best and most important part of being human.</p>
