<h3>Solar Reflective Paint</h3>

    Right now in Japan toyota is launching a prius with a truly ugly paint job. It is also worth noting the paint is supposed to save you money on gas.

    According to the article on hot days 5%- 25% of your fuel consumption in your car can come from
    blasting your air conditioner. To be clear I hate being hot. There are very few times that I don’t
    have the air conditioner on in any car I am in. The idea that somehow this paint could save me
    money is a bit enticing.

    The thought behind it is to make a paint that reflects most of the sun’s thermal radiation and
    therefore keep the car cooler than it otherwise would have been. It does this through using a
    special type of paint that contain tiny reflective particles to, well, reflect the sun. It also
    does not use a “carbon black”, a ingredient used in many other paints that stores a ton of heat.
    So, you think to yourself, “Hmm what a great new idea that has never been thought of before”.

    Well as it turns out white paint has all of the same properties as this new paint. They have just
    figured out how to color it. I know that takes away from the majesty of the new fangled paint, but
    I felt it was important to point out. Don’t misjudge me I do actually like the idea quite a bit.

    It is very clear that they went through a classic design event tree. They wanted to save gas. They
    determined all of the things that used up extra gas. The felt that the air conditioner could be
    improved. They looked at all possible reasons people use the air conditioner. The determined that
    the car was just too hot to begin with, so they effectively added a bunch of mirrors to the
    outside of the car. This is a pretty classic way of solving design problems. Come up with a
    problem, and determine what caused it.

    While I do not think that I agree with the color decisions, I do think the process and end result
    are interesting. Solving gas consumption through paint is novel. I hope to take that kind of
    thinking with me to every one of my problems. I do not just want to find easy solution, but also
    think outside the box. I just hope that my solution are not lime green.
