<h3>The Genius of the English Plug</h3>

    For those of you who do not know I am from the US. I have travelled a fair amount in my time and
    in doing so have had to use all manner of other countries plugs. I honestly never even thought
    about the design of something like that until I watched this video.

    The image above shows the english plug. I always thought it looked kind of stupid. But,
    according to the video it is a masterful piece of engineering and design. We will start with
    the prongs. The center prong does not actually have electricity flowing through it, it is
    just a ground. The other two do have engery flow through them. This means that they are
    dangerous. You may notice that the metal only goes partway up the prong. This is so that
    when a plug is only in half way it will not be able to be shock anything.

    The second major design descision is with the outlet itself. In the picture above you can see
    that the two holes in the bttom are actually closed off right now. The only way to open them is
    to have something in the top whole (the ground). This means that the only way a toddler could
    stick a fork into the dangerous holes was if they had already done so for the ground. It is
    pretty easy to see that this drastically reduces the need for those awful plastic covers.

    Lastly is the wiring of the plug. You can see that the wire going to the top of the plug is
    actually longer than the other two. This mean that if, for whatever reason, the cord gets pulled
    out of the plug, there is a much greater chance that the ground wire will survive. For those of
    you who are a bit rusty on you electrical engineering, this means that any dangerous electricity
    can flow through that instead of into your dog.

<p>
    The thing I took away most from this was design can exist even in the most unlikely places. I
    would have never thought about how much time an effort went into this tiny plug. Beyond that
    the best designs are not really noticed by the users. I don't generally thank the outlet when
    a toddler sticks something in there. I just assume the kid was lucky and move one. Sometimes
    it is nice to look around and be thankful for all the things I didn't notice.
