<h3>Shaping Time in the Digital Age</h3>

<p>A short summary of this article is people don’t mind waiting if they have a nice experience. In the article they claim that studies show that users rate the amount of time they waited less on the actual amount of time and more on their perception of the time.</p> 
	
<p>What I mean by this is that if the user comes to a site, finds what they need easily, and leaves with no noticeable problems, they will think their experience was fast compared to a faster site with worse design. This is an interesting implication for designers and developers.</p>

<p>I know that many developers are very concerned with runtime and efficiency, and on large scales it does matter, but when the times they are reducing are only fractions of seconds, it might be better to spend their time on the design of the application. </p>

<p>There are of course exceptions to this rule. According to the article, “Amazon calculated that an increased loading time of just one second could cost it $1.6 billion in sales each year”. This is a special case and should not be applied to every company. Amazon already has one of the best designs in the business and because of this they can focus on the tiny seconds it takes to load a page. For most companies though, it is worth it to invest more time into the UX of the site, because it will seem faster to the user.</p>

<p>The article gives 6 principles to achieve these design goals.</p> 

<p>First is “Keep Users Engaged”. By this they mean, when users are waiting, keep them entertained with something, a quote, a button, a joke. This makes the wait feel less like waiting and more like doing.</p>

<p>Second is “Perform Actions Optimistically”. Taking a lesson from instagram, this idea mean show feedback instantly and ignore loading icons. Assume that the user action is going to work and let them know if it doesn’t. This makes actions feel instant to the user even if it takes few seconds in the backend.</p>

<p>Third is “Create Transitional Interfaces”. Animation has become staple in design and adding it to a page allows for the user to know where they are in the digital world as well as give time to load content.</p> 

<p>Fourth is “Avoid Spinners”. The little spinners you see whenever ajax is getting something from the server has become ingrained in users as a bad thing. When possible avoid using them. This doesn’t mean you can never use them, just make sure they are small and apply to small things, not the whole UI.
 Fifth is “Communicate Longer Waits”. Long waits are not always avoidable, so when they must happen make sure the user know what is happening. For example a progress bar should accurately show how much percentage is left. Lying will only make it worse from the user's point of view.</p> 

<p>Sixth is “Load Content Progressively”. This means that when a picture loads it will first be pixelated, then blurry, then sharp. This allows the user to know something will be there and approximately what will be there. No more should they wait for an image to load line by line.</p> 

<p>There are a few major takeaways that I will try to incorporate into my life. First is that speed is not everything. Second is design can make or break it. Last is know how your users feel and make sure you accommodate that.</p>
