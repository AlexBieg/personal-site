    So I this is the second article I have reviewed on this blog about automated art. The first
    was about <a href="http://alexbieg.com/#/blog/automatic-orchestra">Automated Orchestra</a>.
    So I will try not to repeat myself.

    Above is an art piece by Casey Reas. It is a moving, breathing, and feels alive. I think that
    is what drew me to the article. I found myself just staring at this piece instead of reading
    the article. It is capitvating. What makes it even more crazy to me is that it was created
    by a computer.
</p>

<p>
    This is something that comes up a lot when trying to create AI. You are writing code that will
    do things that you won't think of. So how do you write code for that? How do you design for
    that? These are questions that probably do not have a simple concise answer. But I do think it
    is a topic worth exploring.
</p>

<p>
    If we think of AI we generally think of either Terminator or HAL 9000. Neither of these
    computers have particularly nice conoatations. One thing these movies generally leave out
    is the process for designing the programs.
</p>

<p>
    These designers had to make something that could do things that had never occured to them. That
    is a crazy thing to have to do. I truly admire these, fictional, people who can do such things.
    But I forget myself, Reas is doing this. Albiet on a smaller scale. He made something that can
    create things he himself could never do. So to him I tip my hat.
</p>

<p>
    So what am I going to take with me from this article. Well I think that most designs, while not
    as complex as AI, have to deal with unknown variables. Any designer must think outside the box
    and create something that can handle a variety of situations. They must try to make it robust
    enough to handle things that might not even exist yet. So that is what I will try to do in the
    future.
