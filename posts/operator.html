    So generally I care very little about fonts. There are too many of them and most of them look about
    the same to me. There is one notable exception (as, for most generalities, there usually is), and
    that is coding. I care a lot about how my code looks in a text editor and I think most other
    people, who code, do as well. That is why I found this article interesting.

    The image above shows what the Operator font looks like. For those of you who do not know it is
    relatively important for fonts used for coding to be monospace. They allow for lines of the same
    number of characters to be the same length. It sounds boring when you are just talking about it,
    but it helps a ton when scrolling through a 1000 line document you wrote 2 years ago.

    This font was supposedly designed for coding. Obviously this enticed me. Looking through the
    article they had reasons for all of their decisions, but I don’t know if they actually help
    anyone. It looks very nice from a graphic design perspective and I like trying to innovate
    whenever possible, but I just don’t think the font delivers what it promises.

    You can see above the font in an IDE (I think it is Atom for those interested). It is worth noting
    that I am ignoring the styling of the font. Mostly because I hate that color scheme and do not
    want it affecting my opinion of the font. Most of the first block of code looks fine to me. The
    second block is where I start to lose their thought process. For some reason the decided to
    include cursive letters into the font. You can see this when they type “classname”. I do not
    know what could have possessed them to do this. There has never been someone sitting at a
    computer coding for hours on end thinking to themselves “hmm I wish my code was harder and
    more confusing to read”. Maybe this is just a millennial thing. I technically learned
    cursive, but I never used it past third grade. So to me this makes no sense.

<p>
    I think all of the problems I see within this font stem from not enough user testing. I
    do not think many coders would have liked the cursive if they had been asked. So I guess
    that is my main takeaway. While innovation is great and useful, it can really suck if  you do
    not test enough with your target audience.
