<p>Daniel Goddmeyer created Subspotting, an app that tracks available cell service in the New York subway. It works for all major carriers. The gist of the app is that there are certain points throughout the New York subway system that people can get cell service. For most modern day people life runs through your phone, so these moments are important. </p>

<p>He rode the entire subway system carrying 4 cell phones, one for each carrier. Each cell phone tracked the reception every two seconds. By the end he had enough data to create a cell service map of the subway. The entire process to two weeks. </p>

<p>The app comes with a very nice looking visualization of New York and the cell service locations. Each route is available as well as different carriers.</p>

<p>I have one major concern about the app. The longevity of the data. It took Daniel two weeks to ride around the city. If the carriers add more towers he will have to do so again. If the app does not do so already it should gather data about the service. This automation might be difficult to implement but would save tons of time overall.</p> 

<p>While the article was very short I love the idea behind it. I like trying to solve everyday problems with technology. We have all experienced a cell service blackout right when we need to call someone. So this hits home with me and I assume many of you. </p>
