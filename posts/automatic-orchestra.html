    I am fairly selective with the music I listen to. I have my artists and I listen to them.
    I do not think this makes me particularly happy, so lately I have been trying to listen to new
    music. I stumbled across this.

    stumbled across this.

    The entire song was composed by algorithms. This may not be too hard to believe considering how
    inhuman it sounded, but I think that is insanely cool. The whole process works in series. There
    are 12 speakers that are hooked up in a line. Each one has it’s own specific algorithm. The first
    one sends its data to the second, the second to the third and so on. They all have ways they are
    programmed to interact with the data.

    Some might drop the note by an octave. Another might add beats in between the current beats. By the
    end of the cycle each device will be creating it’s own music in concert (pun intended) with the
    others.
</p>

<p>
    The article mentions that the music will drastically change depending on who wrote the algorithm,
    so it is worth noting that human interaction is still needed for different sounds. I think this
    brings up an interesting point. The creators called this an automatic orchestra, but it still
    needs developers to change its sound. So how automatic is it really. I suppose that is a matter
    of opinion.

    The entire idea of music created by non-sentient objects is very strange. Most if not all music is
    created to elicit emotions. How can something without emotions try to create them in others? Well
    as some of you know music is much more mathematical than you might imagine. Each octave has
    properties the same as the next. Notes work in chords because of wavelengths synching up. So it is
    not totally crazy that a device whose entire job is to calculate things might be able to make music.
</p>

<p>
    I will be honest I am not a huge fan of most of the music it created. This doesn’t mean I
    don’t think it is impressive and very exciting. I am just too picky. I hope this trend continues
    and more and more music is created this way. I would love to see how the musical environment
    changes as the beings who make it change as well.

    Here is my favorite song that it has made so far.
