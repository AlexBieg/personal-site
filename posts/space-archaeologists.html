    We have space archaeologists?!?! Why was I never told this? That sounds so cool. I want to be
    a space archaeologist.

    So now that I have calmed down, lets talk about this amazing sounding profession. Sarah Parcak
    is one of the aformentioned space archraeologists. She is a very impressive lady. Just one
    example of this is when she won the 2016 $1 million TED Prize. Her job is to find sites on earth
    using satellite images.

<p>
    The way this usually works is she pays a company for some high quality images of places on earth.
    Then she uses some different image filters, such as electromagnetic or infrared spectrum, to find
    indications of human existance. One way is through looking at plant growth. If plants grow on top
    of building, their growth is stunted. She uses this and other signs to find sites. As of today
    she has found

     &quot 17 potential pyramids, upwards of 3,000 settlements, and 1,000 lost tombs—and that’s
     just in Egypt &quot
</p>

<p>
    That is a ton of things to find. She now has a plan to make all of us help her.
    With the money she made from TED she plans to build an app that is a gameifyed verson of her job.
    Effectively she is crowdsourcing archaeology. That is a really cool idea and I think it could
    work if done right.
