                    Who I Am
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a small farming town in Oregon. While I lived there I loved using technology, but had never considered a career
                    in it. When I graduated high school I came to UW originally planning to be a physics major. As it turns
                    out I do not like physics nearly as much as I thought. Luckily I took a programming class and fell in
                    love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then I have been working toward becoming the best developer I can be. I have been lucky to work with some amazing people
                    over the course of my career and through them I have learned so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always loved using, understanding, and, most importantly, changing technology. There are few things that make me as
                    happy as being able to learn and build new technology, because it embodies many of the qualities that
                    I care about: thoughtfulness, dedication, persistence, and intuitiveness. In whatever I am doing I try
                    to bring these qualities to the table to make the product, no matter what it is, the best it can be.
                    I hope to use my skills to work with an amazing team as a software developer.
